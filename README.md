# flightdatadecoded
Initial repo to start development of code to decode flight data of RPAS.  Said analysis to assist in FOQA (flight operations &amp; quality assurance) but individuals, organisations, academics &amp; regulators.

FOQA (Flight Operations Quality Asurance) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_operations_quality_assurance

the key objective of the code developed is to translate the data into information.

Process 
Normalisation -> Segmentation(flight phase) -> contextualisation -> flight event labelling
